# Dungeons-Dragons-Character-Maker
Create a Dungeons &amp; Dragons Character 

The user will be prompted for what character class, race, starting equipment options they decide to start with. All characters will start at 1st level. As the player goes on the adventure, they'll be given options for how the wish to advance their character as they level up. When the game is completed, they'll be given an option to save the character for their own personal use or discard it. 

The languages used for development are Flask, Python and React.

Part of the website may have Express code as part of it ... We'll see as i am learning Software Engineering Full Stack coursework...
For example, as i am learning, this readme.me will change to update my coding knowledge.
I see advantages for Flask and I see advantages for Express...

Either way, when my project is complete, I want the user/player to enjoy their adventuring In Dungeons & Dragons... 
Hopefully, any players that load the webpage will realize that the particular play style is based on choices ... They'll be presented with 3 - 5 buttons wiht text on them deciding what they plan to do based on specific encounters... And depending on their choices /// Conditional Programming ... That's why i prefer Python rather than JavaScript... Easier to read by developers... And when the character they create goes through this adventure, they'll notice that the leveling up may NOT look like what they may be used to!
