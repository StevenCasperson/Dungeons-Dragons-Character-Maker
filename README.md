# Dungeons-Dragons-Character-Maker
Create a Dungeons & Dragons Character

The user will be prompted for what character class, race, starting equipment options they decide to start with. All characters will start at 1st level. As the player goes on the adventure, they'll be given options for how the wish to advance their character as they level up. When the game is completed, they'll be given an option to save the character for their own personal use or discard it. 

The languages used for development are Flask, Python and SQAlchemy.

Either way, when my project is complete, I want the user/player to enjoy their adventuring In Dungeons & Dragons with a character they just made. 
An option to download the character stored in .pdf file will be available on the last screen. 

Any players that load the webpage will realize that the particular play style is based on choices ... They'll be presented with 3 - 5 buttons with text on them deciding what they plan to do based on specific encounters... And depending on their choices /// Conditional Programming ... And when the character they create goes through this adventure, they'll notice that the leveling up may NOT look like what they may be used to!
